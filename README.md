Developed a comprehensive web platform aimed at enhancing opportunities for rural women by integrating job portals, government schemes, and detailed scheme information.

Dynamic User Interface: Designed and implemented a responsive and intuitive interface with an automatic update feature that ensures the latest job postings, government schemes, and resources are prominently displayed on the home page for immediate access.
Seamless Integration: Integrated various job portals and government databases, creating a unified hub where users can easily explore job opportunities, access up-to-date information on government programs, and benefit from available resources.
This platform empowers rural women by offering a comprehensive, dynamic, and accessible solution to connect with job opportunities and government support, ultimately fostering greater economic and social inclusion.
